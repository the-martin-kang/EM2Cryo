_EM2Cryo: AI-assisted 3D reconstruction of yeast cells from SEM/TEM images and comparison with Cryo-ET tomograms_

### Motivation
> Recent advances in electron microscopy have enabled detailed structural analysis of cells at nanometer scales.
> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides high-resolution surface morphology, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers internal contrast through thin sections. However, each modality alone captures only a partial view of cellular structure.
> 
> Cryogenic electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for three-dimensional visualization of cells in near-native states, yet it requires complex experimental setups, large datasets, and sophisticated reconstruction pipelines. As a result, Cryo-ET is not always readily accessible for exploratory or educational-scale studies.
> 
> This project is motivated by the question of whether integrating SEM and TEM images with computational and AI-assisted methods can yield complementary structural insights that are not obtainable from each modality alone.
> Rather than aiming for true volumetric reconstruction, we explore a shape-based pseudo-3D representation derived from SEM surface geometry, augmented with internal contrast information from TEM images.
> 
> By comparing these pseudo-3D representations with publicly available Cryo-ET tomograms of yeast cells, we aim to critically assess what types of structural information can be captured, approximated, or fundamentally missed by SEM/TEM-based approaches.

<국문 요약>
본 연구는 SEM과 TEM 영상으로부터 효모 세포의 외형 및 내부 대비 정보를 통합하여 형상 기반 pseudo-3D 구조를 생성하고, 이를 Cryo-ET 토모그램과 비교함으로써 SEM/TEM 융합 접근법의 가능성과 한계를 탐색하는 것을 목표로 한다.
### Research Questions
1. Can a shape-based pseudo-3D representation of yeast cells be constructed from SEM images using computational or AI-assisted methods?
2. How can internal contrast information from TEM images be integrated into SEM-derived pseudo-3D structures at the feature or visualization level?
3. When compared with Cryo-ET tomograms, which structural characteristics (e.g., overall shape, symmetry, internal density distribution) are consistently captured by SEM/TEM-based approaches, and which are not?
4. What are the fundamental limitations of SEM/TEM-based pseudo-3D reconstruction when evaluated against Cryo-ET as a reference modality?

Through these questions, this project aims to clarify the scope, utility, and limitations of multi-modal electron microscopy integration for exploratory structural analysis.
